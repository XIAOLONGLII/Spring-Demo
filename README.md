# Spring-Demo
This is my first Spring Demo, I will keep working on it. 
After this prject I will understand how Spring and Hibernate works. 
//constructor

2. Create a constructor in your class for injection
3.Configure the dependency injection in Spring config file

//setter
1. Create setter methods() in your class for injecttion
2. Configure the dependency injection in Spring config file
